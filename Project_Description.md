### Objectives

RAINDROP leverages a unique collaboration between software and data engineering, cloud platforms and runtimes, and infrastructure management. It will allow application designers to build and gradually adapt microservices applications from a cloud (data center) target towards novel distributed cloud infrastructures such as the edge-cloud continuum and multi-site (micro-cloud) environments.

At the heart of the project will lie the synergy between three complementary forms of adaptation:

- for applications deployment, placement, and configuration during their execution,
- for the support infrastructure under dynamic demand and availability of resources,
- and through the necessary software evolution to make applications increasingly able to benefit from such automated runtime deployments over the edge-core continuum.

The interoperation between these different classes of adaptations will leverage common application and infrastructure models, and enable a feedback loop between runtime observations and developers enacting software evolution.

RAINDROP will leverage best practices in cloud application development and operation, and intend to significantly improve programmability and abstraction for cloud developers wishing to take advantage of the promising, but demanding and complex novel core-edge infrastructures.

The overall vision of RAINDROP is illustrated by the figure below.
