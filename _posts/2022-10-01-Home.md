<h1>Cross-stack Adaptation for the Edgification of Microservices Applications (RAINDROP)</h1>

<h4>Project started in Oct 2022</h4>

<a><img src="/images/raindrop-logo.png" height="40%" width="40%" style="float: left;"></a>The RAINDROP project brings together three complementary teams from UNamur and UCLouvain to address in a unique way the challenge of building, deploying, and operating applications on upcoming cloud infrastructures formed of a continuum of core (data centers) and edge resources. It targets the demanding class of collaborative and latency-sensitive applications for which the use of edge resources close to users should allow interactions and collaborations with greatly reduced latencies and increased responsiveness, enabling new classes of usages such as collaborative work in near-real-time, virtual spaces, or smart environments.
